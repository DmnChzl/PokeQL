# PokeQL

I made a **Pokédex** app (in French) based on my own progression in the **Pokémon** Go game, with this technologies:

- **ExpressJS**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist Web Framework for NodeJS
  - [http://expressjs.com/](http://expressjs.com/)

- **Mongoose**: Elegant MongoDB object modeling for NodeJS
  - [https://mongoosejs.com/](https://mongoosejs.com/)

- **GraphQL**: A query language for your API
  - [https://graphql.org/](https://graphql.org/)

- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript
  - [https://www.typescriptlang.org/](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  
- **VueJS**: The Progressive JavaScript Framework
  - [https://vuejs.org/](https://vuejs.org/)

- **Apollo**: Replace many inflexible APIs with a single versatile query system
